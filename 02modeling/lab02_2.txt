a.
	I would do something like CHECK (vote > 1000 or score IS NULL) which would only add a record if
it has over 1000 votes or if the score is null.

b. 
	One example would be for multiple views. One view might want to be able to see all the data, but another
may only care about a subset of the data, which a togglable constraint would help enable.
