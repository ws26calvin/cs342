	ii. Attributes are the names of the column headers in a table.
	iii. Domain is a set of values that cannotbe broken up,
	iv. n-tuples are tuples with n elements, where n is an integer
	v. Null values represent unknown values.
	vi. Primary keys are the identifying elements of a table that is unique to each entry, foreign keys are primary keys from other tables.
		super keys are unique sets of attributes that no other tuples possess.
	vii. A referencing record has a foreign key that is a primary key for the referenced record such that referential integrity is maintained.
