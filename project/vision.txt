Vision

	The system project I will develop will be a database for the NBA that records the stats for individual players, games as well as for 
teams for the 2016-2017 season. The information for the stats are readily available from sites such as nba.com. This database will allow searches
for individual games and players, searches that filter out specific teams and players based on criteria and other comparisons that commonly necessary.
The various stakeholders should all be able to do some basic searches and filtering and can see basic stats, but basic users would only be able 
to do this. Another view for more advanced users would allow the user to pick and choose which stats the user wants to see. The admin view would allow
for direct manipulation forthe data. There will also be a naive user that updates the database as needed with updated information.
