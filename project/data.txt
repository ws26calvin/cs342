	This data was scraped from basketball-reference.com using python. The module
I used was BeautifulSoup to extract the information from the website. In particular
I scraped from each player's personal page and from the boxscores for the 2016-17
season.
	The normal form that my schema takes is at least 3NF because every attribute that
is not part of the key is dependant on the key. For the Team table, the ID is a 3
character abbreviation for the team that represents its name and its location as well
as what division and conference the team is in. For the Player table, the id identifies
uniquely for a specific player and all of his characteristics, which in this case is 
his full name, birthdate, height, experience in the league, college and the team he plays
on. For the position table, there are two characteristics and its key is a combination of
the playerid and the position, and position is functionally dependant on the player
the playerid represents. The Game table has an ID the uniquely identifies a game and all
of the activities that took place in that time at that date, including the two teams who played, number 
of overtimes and the points that were scored. The table GameStats has a playerid, teamid, gameid
primary key (the teamid is important because players can be traded, so it indicates at that
time which team the player was on) and all of the assorted stats represent the actions of the
player represented by the playerid for the team in teamid at the game represented by the gameid.
