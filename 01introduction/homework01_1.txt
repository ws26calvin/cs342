1a. Department, prerequisite_number and course_number would all need to be changed
1b. We would have to change the format of courses to not include the department name and then only the department column would need to be changed
1c. If we attach each department to a department_id and use the department_id in place of department (for courses that have the department prefixed to the course number, 
	it would need to be changed to use the department_idinstead) in all but one place where the relation between the two is established, it would then only be needed 
	to be updated in a single place.
