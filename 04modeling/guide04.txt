1a.
	1. Relations schemas should be simple, easily explainable and avoid combining multiple attributes
	2. Base relation schemas should not have insertion, deletion or modification anomalies
	3. Avoid placing attributes in a base relation that will frequently be NULL
	4. Design relation schemas so that they can easily be joined across primary and foreign keys if they are properly related, and if they
		are not related, they should not be easily joined.

1b. Functional dependency is where an attribute determines the value of another attribute, which serves as a constraint on the the value being
	determined. Multi-values dependency is where an attribute determines an attribute that in turn determines a third attribute. In this case,
	the third attribute is still dependent on the first.

1c. A superkey is a set of attributes with the property that for every entity in an entity type, it is unique; a key is a set of attributes
	that fulfills the definition of a superkey, but cannot have any attribute removed and remain unique.

1d. BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF and 4NF is a stricter example of 3NF and BCNF. The example in the book uses lot allocation of different counties
	as an example and for BCNF points out that the different tuples for county and lot size violates BCNF and would be decomposed to be normalized

1e. Normalization in relational schemas is done by ensuring every relation in a schema fulfills certain rewuirements, and if they don't, breaking 
	down these relations as necessary, denormalization can be useful to improve queries and related functions and functions by storing the 
	join of higher normal form relations.
