1a. Yes, if the session is exited normally, any changes to the database are committed, it there is some error and/or
the session crashes, none of the changes are kept to the database, so they are aborted.

Atomicity is possible because if there is any issue at any point of the transaction a rollback can be issued to
return the database to its original state.

Consistency is possible because we cannot do anything that would violate the schema in the session is rejected.

Isolation is possible in multiple sessions because a session will not commit to a table that is already being altered 
by another session.

Durability is possible as commit sends all changes to the database which retains its information.
